    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Get More Out of Your SIEM and SOC</h1> 
    <p>A hybrid or co-managed model for security operations center (SOC) and security information and event management (SIEM) can provide the best of both worlds. With hybrid, your company or organization maintains as much control and visibility into your secure environment as you want, while outsourcing whatever cybersecurity responsibilities and functions you want to a managed security services provider to handle. Working with Proficio on a hybrid or co-managed SIEM or SOC as a service gives you:</p>

             <h1 >SIEM Rescue with Hybrid</h1>
             <p>Many companies and organizations already have made a significant investment in SIEM, only to find that they lack the resources or knowledge to maintain the software for optimal results. In other cases, companies want to have a back-up system in place to further protect their sensitive data, extend their security operations to 24/7 or simply have another set of eyes on the threats and incident logs they are already receiving from their own SIEM as an added layer of protection. Such an arrangement, commonly called a “hybrid SIEM,” can be a cost-effective, fast and reliable way to help better protect your customer data. By working with an outsourced cybersecurity partner, companies can achieve better visibility into the cyberthreats they are facing and better understand the challenges of protecting their sensitive data.</p>

    <p>If your company or organization has already purchased software for security information and event management (SIEM), you have  made a sizable financial and manpower investment to help keep your sensitive data safe. But just having SIEM in place is not enough to adequately protect your sensitive data and customer information. Without the detailed use cases, correlation rules and other intelligence built into your SIEM, the software will not perform as you need and it will not sufficiently detect cyber threats to your secure environment. Hiring Proficio to co-manage your existing SIEM or building a hybrid arrangement for SIEM allows you to keep and leverage your organization’s investment in an on-premises SIEM by adding Proficio’s expert analysts, processes and 24/7 SOC. Our cybersecurity experts can:</p>
    <ul class="security-list">
        <li>Tune your SIEM</li>
        <li>Add correlation rules</li>
        <li>Build hundreds of use cases</li>
        <li>Perform administration SIEM duties</li>
        <li>Improve your SIEM's performance</li>
        <li>Get better cybersecurity posture</li>

Our security operations center as a service is the most flexible in the industry and can address most deployment models and service permutations that our clients require. Some companies prefer to outsource all aspects of SIEM administration, event logging and 24/7 expert monitoring, while others choose a hybrid or co-managed model, where Proficio provides a fully managed cloud-based SIEM service while the client monitors and remediates their own security events. Others want to maintain their own on-premises SIEM, but are looking for our help to either remotely administer their SIEM or monitor alerts outside of normal business hours.</p>
